their designs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first published sighting of a Hidden Mickey was by Arlen Miller who wrote an article on them for Walt Disney World&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eyes and Ears&rdquo; (a Cast Member weekly publication) in 1989. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It actually started out as an inside joke among the Imagineers and has become a park tradition.&nbsp; In the late 1970&rsquo;s and early 1980&rdquo;s because the Disney Company had decided that EPCOT Center would be a more adult park which included selling alcohol.&nbsp; Disney characters and alcohol was deemed an improper combination and it was decided that none of the characters including Mickey Mouse would be seen at EPCOT Center. This became a challenge to the Imagineers and they started including hidden Mickey Mouse profiles in various different elements of the park.&nbsp; As the park grew guest comments let Disney to include characters in EPCOT Center but the tradition of the Hidden Mickeys was already born and has become a staple in all of the theme park designs since.&nbsp;So on your next visit, see how many Hidden Mickeys you can find!<br />&nbsp;<br />Fun facs-<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Disney Management has yet to officially acknowledge the existence of the Hidden Mickey.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />A true Hidden Mickey is one that is not meant to be seen immediately.&nbsp; It is usually purposefully placed by a Disney Imagineer or artist in a context that wouldn&rsquo;t normally contain Mickey Mouse.<br />&nbsp;<br />No one knows exactly how many Hidden Mickeys there are as attractions are closed, refurbished or replaced by new ones.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Have you ever searched for Hidden Mickeys? &nbsp;How many did you find? &nbsp;You can check out HiddenMickeyGuy.com to see the locations of some!</div>

One of my most favorite restaurants at Walt Disney World is the Whispering Canyon Cafe located at The Wilderness Lodge. &nbsp;It's a themed restaraunt that is A LOT of fun! Especially if you have kids! The best part is, the food is really great too! You've got a couple of options... to "Jump in and play" or to "Watch from the fence." &nbsp; If you choose to "Jump in and play" you'll enjoy a sometimes sarcastic server who will keep the laughs coming through out dinner. &nbsp;We find it d [...]

They get bored and can sometimes be loud which I know affects the person next to us so we try and be courteous. &nbsp;The Whispering Canyon Cafe has a bit of a rowdy environment so it isn't a big deal. &nbsp;At one point when we first sat down my two year old didn't want to be in a high chair so he was whining/crying and the server looks over from the table next to us and says "Now stop that! Nobody wants to hear that! You are at the happiest place on earth!!" &nbsp;Shocked, he just looked at her and stopped. &nbsp;It was hilarious.&nbsp;<br /><br />The food.... &nbsp;The most popular menu item and the one that we've enjoyed on our visits is the "All you care to enjoy skillet" it starts you off&nbsp;<br /><span>&nbsp;with Family-style Mixed Greens tossed in an Apple Vinaigrette Dressing and Fresh-baked Cornbread.&nbsp;Then comes the &nbsp;Slow-smoked Pork Ribs, Barbecued Pulled Pork, Roasted Chicken, Oak-roasted Beef Strip Loin, and Western-style Sausage served with Seasonal Farm Fresh Vegetables, Mashed Yukon Potatoes, Corn on the Cobb, and Cowboy-style Baked Beans.&nbsp;</span><br /><br />The great thing about this all you can eat skillet, is it's not your traditional buffet style. &nbsp;They bring you a skillet for your table filled with the food and then as you want more they bring it to you. &nbsp; It's $29.99 for an adult and $11.99 for kids, but it's well worth it! &nbsp;It's some of the best BBQ I've ever had (and being from the South I've had a lot!). &nbsp;Another fun feature is that you can get milkshakes with dinner and the refills are unlimited! &nbsp; While this was very exciting to my four year old, she only got half way through one milkshake :).&nbsp;<br /><br />To go along with the sassy fun natured wait staff, there is also hobby horse riding, and napkin twirling to add to a rowdy night's dinner. &nbsp; It's definitely worth checking out and a nice break from the parks. &nbsp; &nbsp;Reservations are recommended or show up right when they open at 5:00. &nbsp;They fill up fast and I saw them turning away multiple people.&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh... one last thing, on your visit, don't forget to ask for ketchup!</div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>

And let's not forget about the beignets that are found at Port Orleans French Quarter!&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Check out the video below!</div><div><div id="690661974636282447" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tYZAIc9oIA?list=PL38E2ED5E20C380EC" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div>
